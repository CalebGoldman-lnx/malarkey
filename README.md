A paraody of Omarachy by DHH

Do you like the concept of Omarchy, but you hate everything it stands for? 
Then malarkey has got you covered! So far, it replaces everything ruby related 
with its lua counterparts. Along with removing neovim and replacing it with the 
extremely popular emacs! More features are on the way!

## Upcoming features
* an ISO image for installation
* Replacing hyprland with a different (better) window manager.
* A preinstalled list of every race DHH has lost.
